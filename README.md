# Knock Knock Robot using Pioneer & Kinect
The final project of course Robotics in CSIE, National Taiwan University.
Team members: Sing-Yao Wu, Hung-Hao Chen, Vitor, and Yun-Hua Wang.

This work addresses a method to visit all the doors in the same floor with a mobile robot, from door-to-door in order to send speech messages during festivals automatically. In order to do so we use a Pioneer robot combined with a Microsoft Kinect and laser devices. We build a local environment map by laser-based mapping system and localize the robot by a probabilistic localization system. We also use a fast interpolated navigation function to plan a reachable path for each door and a face detection method so as to determine if someone comes out from the visiting door. This work can send speech messages between several designated locations with reachable paths if there is a person at thoseparticular locations.

See [Report](https://github.com/singyaowu/Robotics_NavigationRobot/blob/master/Robotics_Final_Report.pdf) for detail implementation.
